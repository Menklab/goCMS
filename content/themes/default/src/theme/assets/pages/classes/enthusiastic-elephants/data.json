Before leaving our Elephants class, we would like the children to have a solid foundation of colors and shapes. Each child in our Elephants classroom is taking one nap a day, enjoying our nutritional menu, and is learning to use utensils. Each child will be given an opportunity to be introduced to (or continue to work on) potty training as well.",
