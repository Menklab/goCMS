This experience consists of a morning circle time with calendar and our weekly theme, learning area activities centered around art, more challenging math and science skills, with an additional emphasis on both upper and lowercase letters through Zoophonics. Throughout the year, we continue with self-help skills in our preparation to Kindergarten Readiness. Our Patient Penguins classroom is taking one nap a day, playing outdoors twice a day, and enjoying our nutritional menu.",
