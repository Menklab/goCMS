They will enter as infants but during their time in the Critters, they will gain more toddler independence. The teachers will begin with short small group activities centered around story time, art, colors/shapes, texture table time, and an outdoor recess every day. Each child in our Curious Critters classroom will eventually be transitioning to one nap a day, enjoying our nutritional menu, and learning to use eating utensils and drink out of sippy cups. Our highly-qualified teachers enjoy enriching your childâ€™s education and watching them grow each day.",
