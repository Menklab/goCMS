This experience consists of a morning circle time with calendar and our weekly theme, learning area activities centered around art, more challenging math and science skills, with an emphasis on lowercase letters through Zoophonics and Handwriting Without Tears. Midway through the year after a full letter review, the class will begin working with word families to begin their easy reading skills. Throughout the year, we continue to improve self-help skills in our preparation for Kindergarten Readiness. Our Raccoons classroom is taking one nap a day, playing outdoors twice a day, and enjoying our nutritional menu.",
